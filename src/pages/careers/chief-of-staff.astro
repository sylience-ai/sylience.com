  title="Chief of Staff - Sylience"
  role="Chief of Staff"
  description="Join Sylience as Chief of Staff and drive critical initiatives."
>
  <p>As Chief of Staff, you'll own critical initiatives for driving the business forward and scaling the organization, focusing on the highest leverage points on any given day. You'll step into ambiguous situations, figure out what needs to happen, and make it happen. As the business matures, you might continue to grow your responsibilities as an operational leader, or you might shift your focus to the specialization closest to your heart, whether that's people, business development, or product management.</p>

  <h2>You will:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Partner with the CEO on early go-to-market and user acquisition and help establish Chord's product–market fit.</li>
    <li>Drive recruiting and onboarding for the first few team members and establish the necessary systems and processes to support ongoing hiring.</li>
    <li>Handle essential operational workstreams across finance, legal, HR, and compliance.</li>
    <li>Acquire and onboard the tools and services necessary to accelerate Chord's success. Manage external partnerships and vendor relationships.</li>
    <li>Support future fundraising efforts as needed.</li>
    <li>Help shape company culture and establish the operating principles that let us rapidly grow the business while staying accountable to the mission.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>You may be a good fit if:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You've worked in broadly scoped roles where you wore many hats and dealt with new challenges every week.</li>
    <li>You have strong judgment and can make decisions with incomplete information.</li>
    <li>You communicate clearly and concisely in writing.</li>
    <li>You take ownership and operate independently. No task is too small, but you don't shirk from big responsibilities either. You get things done.</li>
    <li>You believe the development of AI poses extremely important questions for humanity, and you're excited to improve our capability for making good collective decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>We don't expect candidates to have done everything, but we'd be excited if:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You've previously worked at an early-stage startup as a Chief of Staff or in a functionally equivalent role.</li>
    <li>You've written marketing copy, worked on SEO, set up ad campaigns, or otherwise supported user acquisition and onboarding.</li>
    <li>You've built and/or run a hiring process end to end.</li>
    <li>You've previously worked in product design, development, or support, so you know what's involved and bring valuable strategic thinking to the table.</li>
    <li>You're comfortable with financial modeling, budgeting, or bookkeeping.</li>
    <li>You've managed people.</li>
  </ul>
