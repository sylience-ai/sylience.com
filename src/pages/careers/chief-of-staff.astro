  <h2>About Chord</h2>

  <section class="section">
    <p>
      As AI companies build increasingly powerful AI systems, humans will have to make
      extremely consequential, perhaps existential, decisions that permanently alter humanity's
      future trajectory. Unfortunately, we don't have the best track record for getting
      high-stakes decisions right on the first try. On the other hand, AI capabilities that
      have already been developed have the potential to help us navigate this transition, by
      improving our reasoning, cooperation, and decision making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chord facilitates consensus building and collective decision making by using AI to
      parallelize group communication. This means that group conversations can incorporate
      the best thinking of more stakeholders, creating richer shared context and better
      understanding of the consequences of decisions and actions. As humans make critical
      decisions over the coming years, Chord will help businesses, governments, and societies
      make better choices according to their own collective values and preferences.

  <h2>About the role</h2>

  <section class="section">
    <p>
      As Chief of Staff, you'll own critical initiatives for driving the business forward
      and scaling the organization. Focusing on the highest leverage points on any given
      day. You'll step into ambiguous situations, figure out what needs to happen, and make
      it happen. As an operational leader, you might focus on the operational-administrative
      side, or product-business development, or product development&mdash;that's a conversation
      we'd like to have with candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll work with the CEO on early go-to-market and user acquisition and help establish credible
      product-market fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chord's success depends on managing external partnerships and vendor relationships,
      supporting future fundraising efforts as needed, and helping shape company culture
      and establishing operating principles that let us rapidly grow the business while
      staying accountable to the mission.
