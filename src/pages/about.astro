  <h2>Sylience's thesis</h2>

  <section class="section">
    <p>
      AI companies are developing increasingly powerful AI systems, with the goal of building
      general-purpose AI that exceeds human ability in practically every domain. Some of
      them expect to achieve this as soon as within the next five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creation of entities more intelligent than humans is no small matter. We don't just need
      to make sure that these entities follow human instructions, and many people think our best
      near-term plan is to ask the slightly less intelligent AI to help us supervise the slightly more
      intelligent AI. But this still leaves us with many other not-so-simple questions about
      humanity's future trajectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, we believe it's crucial to ask not only whether the products we build have the
      potential to help people make better decisions, but whether and how people who make
      decisions will actually use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why we're building Chord, the platform for orchestrated communication.

  <h2 id="chord">Why we're building Chord</h2>

  <section class="section">
    <p>
      Chord uses AI to facilitate and parallelize group communication and decision making.
      "Orchestrated communication" makes better use of each individual's bandwidth and allows
      discussion to incorporate the best thinking of all stakeholders, creating higher-resolution
      shared context and better understanding of the consequences of decisions and actions.
      This helps humans to achieve better outcomes according to their own collective values and preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parallelizing communication also addresses the fundamental inefficiencies of today's
      meetings where people take turns to speak, which helps organizations make decisions faster.
      Solving the acute pain point of ineffective meetings and saving valuable human time provides
      a clear path to commercial success and rapid broad adoption. This means that orchestrated
      communication can become as ubiquitous for group communication as conferencing tools are today,
      leading to better decisions across the board.
