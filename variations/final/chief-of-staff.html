    <h1>Chief of Staff</h1>
    <p class="location">Remote · US timezones preferred</p>

    <p>As Chief of Staff, you'll own critical initiatives for driving the business forward and scaling the organization, focusing on the highest leverage points on any given day. You'll step into ambiguous situations, figure out what needs to happen, and make it happen. As the business matures, you might continue to grow your responsibilities as an operational leader, or you might shift your focus to the specialization closest to your heart, whether that's people, business development, or product management.</p>

    <h2>You will:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Partner with the CEO on early go-to-market and user acquisition and help establish Chord's product–market fit.</li>
      <li>Drive recruiting and onboarding for the first few team members and establish the necessary systems and processes to support ongoing hiring.</li>
      <li>Handle essential operational workstreams across finance, legal, HR, and compliance.</li>
      <li>Acquire and onboard the tools and services necessary to accelerate Chord's success. Manage external partnerships and vendor relationships.</li>
      <li>Support future fundraising efforts as needed.</li>
      <li>Help shape company culture and establish the operating principles that let us rapidly grow the business while staying accountable to the mission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>You may be a good fit if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You've worked in broadly scoped roles where you wore many hats and dealt with new challenges every week.</li>
      <li>You have strong judgment and can make decisions with incomplete information.</li>
      <li>You communicate clearly and concisely in writing.</li>
      <li>You take ownership and operate independently. No task is too small, but you don't shirk from big responsibilities either. You get things done.</li>
      <li>You believe the development of AI poses extremely important questions for humanity, and you're excited to improve our capability for making good collective decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>We don't expect candidates to have done everything, but we'd be excited if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You've previously worked at an early-stage startup as a Chief of Staff or in a functionally equivalent role.</li>
      <li>You've written marketing copy, worked on SEO, set up ad campaigns, or otherwise supported user acquisition and onboarding.</li>
      <li>You've built and/or run a hiring process end to end.</li>
      <li>You've previously worked in product design, development, or support, so you know what's involved and bring valuable strategic thinking to the table.</li>
      <li>You're comfortable with financial modeling, budgeting, or bookkeeping.</li>
      <li>You've managed people.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="compensation">
      <h2>Compensation</h2>
      <p><strong>Salary:</strong> $80,000–$150,000 USD depending on experience and on your cash vs equity preference, with a market-adjustment review at Series A.</p>
      <p><strong>Equity:</strong> 0.5–3% depending on experience and salary requirements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="apply-section">
      <h2>Apply</h2>
      <p>Send your resume to <a href="mailto:careers@sylience.com">careers@sylience.com</a> with the subject line "Application for Chief of Staff role - [Your Name]".</p>
      <p>Optionally, please feel free to include 1–2 sentences in your email about any or all of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Why you're interested in Chord;</li>
        <li>Why you think you'd be a good fit;</li>
        <li>Anything else you think we should know.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="encouragement">If you think you'd be a good fit for this role, we encourage you to apply even if you don't check every box. Research shows that people from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we especially encourage such candidates not to self-select out.</p>
        <p class="encouragement">If you think there's a different role we should hire you for, feel free to pitch us on why we should be excited about that.</p>
